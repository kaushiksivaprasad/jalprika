In imaging science, image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame; the output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Most image-processing techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensional signal and applying standard signal-processing techniques to it.
Image processing refers to processing of a 2D picture by a computer. Basic definitions:
An image defined in the “real world” is considered to be a function of two real variables, for example, a(x,y) with a as the amplitude (e.g. brightness) of the image at the real coordinate position (x,y).
Modern digital technology has made it possible to manipulate multi-dimensional signals with systems that range from simple digital circuits to advanced parallel computers. The goal of this manipulation can be divided into three categories:
Image Processing (image in -> image out)
Image Analysis (image in -> measurements out)
Image Understanding (image in -> high-level description out)
Image processing usually refers to digital image processing, but optical and analog image processing also are possible. This article is about general techniques that apply to all of them. The acquisition of images (producing the input image in the first place) is referred to as imaging.

The work involves applying various image processing and analytical methods to specific problems of interest. Of special interest are novel techniques tied to variational segmentation, image and data classification methodologies,
 3-D image processing techniques, image compression, and texture analysis.
This is where you can truly solve real world 3d image processing and facial recognition challenges.  The algorithms you develop and implement are critical to DSC's cutting-edge electro-optic surveillance systems.  You will work closely with like-minded developers, engineers and scientists to develop rock solid, robust and maintainable 
software between complex hardware and software systems.
Pattern Recognition and Java We need someone that is an expert in pattern recognition (corner detection) and image processing. 
We have a Java applet that captures desktop screenshots. We need to be able to extract the component coordinates that is being clicked or typed in (in focus) from the image. The exact coordinates of the mouse click will be given so we 
would need to analyze the surrounding area to get the full coordinates of the component. 

Acquire, process, and analyze images and video for algorithm development and system design

Algorithm development is central to image processing and computer vision because each situation is unique, and good solutions require multiple design iterations. MathWorks provides a comprehensive environment to gain insight into your image 
and video data, develop algorithms, and explore implementation tradeoffs.
