 This position involves research and development in image processing applications that are of potential use within Intel. The work involves applying various image processing and analytical methods to specific problems of interest. Of special interest are novel techniques tied to variational segmentation, image and data classification methodologies,
 3-D image processing techniques, image compression, and texture analysis.
This is where you can truly solve real world 3d image processing and facial recognition challenges.  The algorithms you develop and implement are critical to DSC's cutting-edge electro-optic surveillance systems.  You will work closely with like-minded developers, engineers and scientists to develop rock solid, robust and maintainable 
software between complex hardware and software systems.
Pattern Recognition and Java We need someone that is an expert in pattern recognition (corner detection) and image processing. 
We have a Java applet that captures desktop screenshots. We need to be able to extract the component coordinates that is being clicked or typed in (in focus) from the image. The exact coordinates of the mouse click will be given so we 
would need to analyze the surrounding area to get the full coordinates of the component. 

Acquire, process, and analyze images and video for algorithm development and system design

Algorithm development is central to image processing and computer vision because each situation is unique, and good solutions require multiple design iterations. MathWorks provides a comprehensive environment to gain insight into your image 
and video data, develop algorithms, and explore implementation tradeoffs.
