to Present
ESTECH SYSTEMS INC, Plano, TX
Senior Firmware Embedded Software Engineer
Responsible for architecture, design, development, and testing of real-time, embedded code for a market leader in telephony equipment utilizing TDM and VOIP technologies.  Extensive experience with Motorola/Freescale MCF5206e, MCF5272, MCF5407; TI TMS320C5402, TMS320C5502; and ADSP-2185 processors using C/C++ and assemble.  Responsible for low-level board bring- up, including drivers for flash, SDRAM, network chips, RTC, Compact Flash, IC2, and T1 Framers. Ported, expanded and maintained many DSP algorithm in assembly to different DSP brands to take advantage of vendor pricing.  Algorithm familiarity include: tone generators, CID & DTMF codecs, and echo-cancellers.  Very comfortable with working on board at the hardware interface level.  Familiar with TDM serial bus interfaces as well with VOIP technologies.

ADVANCED IP COMMUNICATION, Richardson, TX
Senior Embedded / Project Leader -Contractor
testing of real-time, embedded code for a startup company to produce a small business phone switch use VoIP.  Developed code for the Motorola MCF5307 processor using C/C++ coupled with RTEMS real-time OS.  Wholly responsible for board check out, Gnu Tools, bring up of the board, writing bios, which provided a network boot, and 80% of the application. The proprietary board included flash, SDRAM, a network chip, a RTC, and Compact Flash.  Also developed code for the TMS32054CST DSP to interface to the coldfire utilitising the Host interface port. Used Assembly for low-level startup, driver ISR and debugging. Administered a Linux Server running 6.2, which we migrated, to 7.3.
